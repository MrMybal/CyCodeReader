## Documents and transactions {#documents}

The native engine owns live text. Revisions and disk baselines are checked before saving; an external change may require review or Save as. Undo/Redo belongs to editor changes. Opening help does not create an editing transaction.

## Encoding and readability {#encoding}

CyCodeReader offers UTF-8, UTF-8 BOM, UTF-16 LE/BE and Windows-1252, with LF, CRLF and CR. Format changes stay pending until saved; undecodable files must not be silently converted.

## Windows, text size and themes {#layout}

Move detachable views to another display. Application controls own text size and themes. Layout restoration and complete historical Undo remain subject to the documented limits.
